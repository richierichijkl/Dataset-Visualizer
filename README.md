# 📊 Streamlit Data Insight Dashboard

An interactive, general-purpose dashboard built using **Streamlit** that accepts **any CSV dataset** and provides **automated statistics, visual insights, and customizable visualizations** — no hardcoding needed!

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Upload **any CSV file**  
✅ Automatically summarizes:
- Structure & metadata
- Missing values
- Descriptive statistics

✅ Explore data with:
- **Histograms**
- **Pie charts**
- **Group-wise bar charts**
- **Top N category distribution**
- **Box plots**
- **Scatter plots**
- **Correlation heatmap**

✅ Dynamic column selection based on data type  
✅ No dependency on fixed columns (e.g., not just churn-specific)  
✅ Minimal UI with **Streamlit sidebar navigation**

## ▶️ Running the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

* Upload any `.csv` file from the sidebar.
* Click on sidebar buttons to explore **statistics**, **dashboard**, or **insights**.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Automatically detects column types:

   * **Numerical**
   * **Categorical**

2. Uses general-purpose plotting:

   * `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pandas` for dynamic charts
   * `Streamlit` for UI interactivity

3. Dynamic chart rendering based on your dataset.

## 🔍 Example Use Cases

* Quick exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Teaching data science concepts
* Lightweight alternative to Pandas Profiling
* Making sense of unfamiliar datasets

---

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

* Correlation Heatmap
* Box Plots by Group
* Scatter Plot (X vs Y)
* Pie Chart of Categorical Fields
* Bar Chart of Top Categories
